;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete list of commands:
;;
;;  `search-forward-number'
;;    Search forward for number which satisfies predicate PRED.
;;    Keybinding: M-x search-forward-number
;;  `search-backward-number'
;;    Search backward for number which satisfies predicate PRED.
;;    Keybinding: M-x search-backward-number
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put search-number.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'search-number)
